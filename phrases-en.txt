Do not be so quick to deal out death and judgment. Even the very wise do not see all ends.
The board is set, the pieces are moving. We come to it at last, the great battle of our time.
When gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. The Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned.
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering.
Choose wisely, for while the true Grail will bring you life, the false Grail will take it from you.
